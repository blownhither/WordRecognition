# Usage
Take anything you want! Comments and suggenstions are welcomed.

The main program is working.py which recognize words from tmp/working/working.txt (generated by MATLAB script described below). This script waits for modification in the txt file (based on modification datatime). A pre-trained model is required. For generating pre-processed file like working.txt, see below about MATLAB script. A pre-trained model will be avaible in the repo.

In pre_process/ , run working.m in MATLAB. This will enable you to interactively record audio to a file so that TensorFlow in Python could read it. You may also place your audio file (when already started Python scirpt described above).
